# BoxingiTimer App Setup

The BoxingiTimer app is a great tool for timing our workouts. Here's how to set it up:

1. Download the BoxingiTimer app from your device's app store.
2. Open the app and create a new timer.
3. Set up the following intervals:
   - Work Time: 20 seconds
   - Rest Time: 10 seconds
   - Rounds: 6
   - Rest Between Rounds: 1 minute
4. Save this timer setup with a name like "Fencing Workout".

## Using the Timer

1. Select your "Fencing Workout" timer.
2. Start the timer at the beginning of each circuit.
3. Follow the work and rest intervals for each exercise.
4. Use the 1-minute rest between rounds to prepare for the next circuit.

Remember to stay hydrated and maintain proper form throughout the workout!
