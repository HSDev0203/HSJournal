# Group Workouts

## Thursday Club Workout (50 Minutes)

### Part 1: Rotational Exercises (15 Minutes)

To accommodate the limited equipment (2 slide boards) and replicate a 3-minute round format, we'll organize the fencers into pairs and rotate them through three stations. Each pair spends 5 minutes per station, including setup and transition time.

#### Stations and Rotations:

1. **Jump Rope Station**
   * Participants: Pair 1
   * Duration: 3 minutes
   * Format:
      * 20 seconds normal pace
      * 10 seconds high-intensity bursts
      * Repeat until 3 minutes are up
   * Rest/Transition: 1 minute to switch stations

2. **Slide Board Lunges Station**
   * Participants: Pair 2
   * Duration: 3 minutes
   * Exercise: Continuous slide board lunges
   * Rest/Transition: 1 minute to switch stations

3. **Agility Circuit Station**
   * Participants: Pairs 3 & 4 (adjust based on group size)
   * Duration: 3 minutes
   * Exercises:
      * Long Jumps down the strip
      * One-Legged Hops back down the strip (switch feet halfway)
      * Duck Walks into Fencing Lunges down the next strip
      * Repeat the sequence
   * Rest/Transition: 1 minute to switch stations

#### Rotation Plan:
* Cycle 1 (First 5 minutes):
   * Pair 1: Jump Rope
   * Pair 2: Slide Board Lunges
   * Pairs 3 & 4: Agility Circuit
* Cycle 2 (Next 5 minutes):
   * Rotate pairs to the next station
* Cycle 3 (Final 5 minutes):
   * Rotate pairs to the final station

Note: Adjust the number of participants at each station based on total group size (6-8 fencers).

### Part 2: Circuit Training (30 Minutes)

#### Format:
* Exercise Duration: 20 seconds
* Rest Between Exercises: 10 seconds (allows time to switch exercises)
* Exercises per Circuit: 6
* Total Circuit Time: 3 minutes
* Rest Between Circuits: 1 minute
* Total Rounds: 6 rounds
* Midway Break: After 3 rounds, take a 2-minute rest

#### Exercises:

2. Push-Ups (modify as needed)
3. Resistance Band Lateral Walks
4. Plank Holds
